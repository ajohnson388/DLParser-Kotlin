## Requirements

- API level 34 or higher

## Installation

### JitPack

Add the dependency to the app-level build.gradle file

`implementation 'com.github.ajohnson388:DLParser-Kotlin:2.0.0'`

## Sample Installation

Clone the repo.

Sync Gradle.

Launch a debug build on a physical device or an emulator using a webcam.

Scan driver license barcodes by using the example app and view output through the console.

NOTE: The example app uses the `GmsBarcodeScanner`. This scanner requires the barcode to be scanned in landscape orientation and must be presented closely to the camera for capture to work. It can take a few seconds and the barcode must be clearly presented.
